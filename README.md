## About Me ##
Hi! My name is Yajie. Currently doing a Master's degree at University of Florida majoring in Web Design. Besides that, I am also doing a certificate online at the University of Washington focusing on UI/UX design. I love traveling and desiging! I hope to be able to use my background in design, foreign cultures and coding to produce useful and appealing products!
## Past Coding Experience ##
I have learned basic HTML and CSS coding on Free Code Camp about a year ago. I got into Unity for a while so I followed tutorials on C# in order to make a pixel game. It was rough, but turned out pretty well.
## Career Goals ##
1. Portfolio Diversification: Create a portfolio website that includes a variety of UX web design projects and demonstrates my ability to solve different design difficulties.
2. Cross-Functional Collaboration: Effectively collaborate with developers, product managers, and stakeholders in cross-functional teams to create a collaborative atmosphere that encourages creativity and innovation.
3. Mastering UI/UX Principles: Gain a thorough understanding of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) principles can help me produce aesthetically pleasing and easily navigable designs that improve user pleasure in general.
